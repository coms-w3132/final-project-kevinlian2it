## Project Title
**Soccer Talent Identifier: Leveraging Machine Learning for Optimal Player-Team Fit**

## Project Description
The Soccer Talent Identifier project leverages machine learning to match soccer players with teams where they are most likely to excel. Motivated by the growing complexity and competitive nature of sports analytics, as well as a huge personal passion for the sport, this project seeks to solve the challenge of identifying optimal player-team fits using data-driven insights. By analyzing detailed player statistics from fbref, we aim to develop predictive models that can recommend player signings based on a team's strategic needs and playing style.

Although most high-level soccer teams already have detailed databases for player scouting, these databases are highly confidential. This project seeks to make player scouting and knowledge more accessible to everyday fans and make fans more informed about players and clubs. The main goals for the semester include successfully scraping and processing player data from fbref, developing and testing machine learning models for player-team matching, and creating a user-friendly interface for accessing these insights.

The project holds significant utility and interest for soccer clubs, scouts, and analytics enthusiasts, offering a novel tool for data-informed decision-making in player acquisition and team development. By harnessing the power of machine learning, the Soccer Talent Identifier promises to bring a new level of precision to the art of building winning teams.

## Timeline

*To track progress on the project, we will use the following intermediate milestones for your overall project. Each milestone will be marked with a tag in the git repository, and we will check progress and provide feedback at key milestones.*

| Date               | Milestone                                                                                              | Deliverables                | Git tag    |

*The column Deliverables lists deliverable suggestions, but you can choose your own, depending on the type of your project.*

## Requirements, Features and User Stories
*List the key requirements or features of your project. For each feature, provide a user story or a simple scenario explaining how the feature will be used. You don't have to get this section right the first time. Your understanding of the problem and requirements will improve as you work on your project. It is okay (and desirable) to come back to this section and revise it as you learn more about the problem you are trying to solve. The first version of this section should reflect your understanding of your problem at the beginning of the project.*

*Also list any required hardware, software, on online services you will need. In specific cases, we might be able to lend you hardware or obtain online services. Please email the instructor for more details.*

Dataset: fbref.com
Data Scraping: Beautiful Soup, Pandas, NumPy

## Technical Specification
*Detail the main algorithms, libraries, and technologies you plan to use. Explain your choice of technology and how it supports your project goals.*

## System or Software Architecture Diagram
*Include a block-based diagram illustrating the architecture of your software or system. This should include major components, such as user interface elements, back-end services, and data storage, and show how they interact. Tools like Lucidchart, Draw.io, or even hand-drawn diagrams photographed and uploaded are acceptable. The purpose of the diagram is to help us understand the architecture of your solution. Diagram asthetics do not matter and will not be graded.*

## Development Methodology
*Describe the methodology you'll use to organize and progress your work.*

*First, describe your plan for developing your project. This might include how (or if) you plan to use*
- *GitHub projects board to track progress on tasks and milestones*
- *GitHub issues to keep track of issues or problems*
- *Separate Git branches and/or GitHub pull requests for development*
- *GitHub actions for automated testing or deployment pipelines*
- *GitHub wiki for documentation and notes*

*Please also describe how (if) you plan test and evaluate your project's functionality. Do you plan to test manually or automatically? Any specific testing frameworks or libraries you plan to use?*

## Potential Challenges and Roadblocks
*Identify any potential challenges or roadblocks you anticipate facing during the development of your project. For each challenge, propose strategies or solutions you might use to overcome them, which may include getting help from the TAs/instructor. This could include technical hurdles or learning new technologies.*

## Additional Resources
*Include any additional resources, tutorials, or documentation that will be helpful for this project.*

## Conclusion and Future Work
*Wrap up your project description with any final thoughts, expectations, or goals not covered in the sections above. Also briefly discuss potential future work, i.e., what could be done next to improve the project.*
